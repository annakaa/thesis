\\
This thesis would not have been possible without the help of many people. First of all, I would like to thank Prof. Karlheinz Brandenburg for being my advisor, and for enabling various cooperations throughout the years. Through these cooperations, I got to meet Prof. Masataka Goto and Dr.-Ing. Sebastian Stober, whom I would like to thank for serving as my reviewers.\\
I am grateful for my time spent at Fraunhofer IDMT, where I learned a lot about research and enjoyed a very warm and friendly working atmosphere. In particular, I would like to thank my colleagues Ania, Estefanía, Jakob, Patrick, Sascha, Christof, Christian, Stelios, and Daniel for their help and inspiration. In addition, I want to thank to my colleagues at AIST and at the Johns Hopkins University for their new perspectives.\\\\

Ich möchte mich bei meiner Familie bedanken, insbesondere bei meinen Eltern, ohne die ich nie so weit gekommen wäre, und bei meinem Opa, der mich immer angefeuert hat. Außerdem bei meinen Freunden für viele Abende mit Bier, Spielen und interessanten Gesprächen. Und natürlich bei Johannes, dem ich noch den größten Eisbecher der Welt schulde.\\\\

%no other road, no other way, no day but today

%Words are flowing out / Like endless rain into a paper cup / They slither while they pass / They slip away across the universe
%There's nothing you can do that can't be done / Nothing you can sing that can't be sung / Nothing you can say, but you can learn how to play the game / It's easy / All you need is love
%It's only a paper moon\\Sailing over a cardboard sea\\But it wouldn't be make-believe\\If you believed in me
%The world always seems brighter when youâ€™ve just made something that wasnâ€™t there before.

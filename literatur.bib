Classifications are performed separately using structure and colour and then combined using a confidence criterion. We apply the models to the VisTex database and to the classification of man-made and natural areas in aerial images. We compare these models with others in the literature, and show an overall improvement in performance.}

abstract = {Neural machine translation is a recently proposed approach to machine transla-tion. Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for neu-ral machine translation often belong to a family of encoderâdecoders and encode a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoderâdecoder architec-ture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the (soft-)alignments found by the model agree well with our intuition.},

abstract = {Many of the current state-of-the-art Large Vocabulary Con-tinuous Speech Recognition Systems (LVCSR) are hybrids of neural networks and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). Most of these systems contain separate components that deal with the acoustic modelling, language modelling and se-quence decoding. We investigate a more direct approach in which the HMM is replaced with a Recurrent Neural Net-work (RNN) that performs sequence prediction directly at the character level. Alignment between the input features and the desired character sequence is learned automatically by an attention mechanism built into the RNN. For each predicted character, the attention mechanism scans the input sequence and chooses relevant frames. We propose two methods to speed up this operation: limiting the scan to a subset of most promising frames and pooling over time the information contained in neighboring frames, thereby reducing source sequence length. Integrating an n-gram language model into the decoding process yields recognition accuracies similar to other HMM-free RNN-based approaches.},

A recurrent neural network operating directly on magnitude spectro-grams is used to model the metrical structure of the audio signals at multiple levels and provides an output feature that clearly distinguishes between beats and downbeats. A dynamic Bayesian network is then used to model bars of variable length and align the predicted beat and down-beat positions to the global best solution. We find that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of different musical genres and styles.},

It does this by learning tasks in parallel while using a shared representation; what is learned for each task can help other tasks be learned better. This paper reviews prior work on MTL, presents new evidence that MTL in backprop nets discovers task relatedness without the need of supervisory signals, and presents newresults forMTLwith k-nearest neighbor and kernel regression. In this paper we demonstrate multitask learning in three domains. We explain how multitask learning works, and show that there are many opportunities for multitask learning in real domains. We present an algorithm and results for multitask learning with case-based methods like k-nearest neighbor and kernel regression, and sketch an algorithm for multitask learning in decision trees. Because multitask learningworks, can be applied to many different kinds of domains, and can be used with different learning algorithms, we conjecture there will be many opportunities for its use on real-world problems.},

abstract = {We present Listen, Attend and Spell (LAS), a neural network that learns to transcribe speech utterances to characters. Unlike traditional DNN-HMM models, this model learns all the components of a speech recognizer jointly. Our system has two components: a listener and a speller. The listener is a pyramidal recurrent network encoder that accepts filter bank spectra as inputs. The speller is an attention-based recurrent network decoder that emits characters as outputs. The network produces character sequences without making any independence assumptions between the characters. This is the key improvement of LAS over previous end-to-end CTC models. On a subset of the Google voice search task, LAS achieves a word error rate (WER) of 14.1{\%} without a dictionary or a language model, and 10.3{\%} with language model rescoring over the top 32 beams. By comparison, the state-of-the-art CLDNN-HMM model achieves a WER of 8.0{\%}.},

abstract = {Neural machine translation is a relatively new approach to statistical machine translation based purely on neural networks. The neural machine translation models often consist of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder extracts a fixed-length representation from a variable-length input sentence, and the decoder generates a correct translation from this representation. In this paper, we focus on analyzing the properties of the neural machine translation using two models; RNN Encoder--Decoder and a newly proposed gated recursive convolutional neural network. We show that the neural machine translation performs relatively well on short sentences without unknown words, but its performance degrades rapidly as the length of the sentence and the number of unknown words increase. Furthermore, we find that the proposed gated recursive convolutional network learns a grammatical structure of a sentence automatically.},

One RNN encodes a sequence of symbols into a fixed-length vector representation, and the other decodes the representation into another sequence of symbols. The encoder and decoder of the proposed model are jointly trained to maximize the conditional probability of a target sequence given a source sequence. The performance of a statistical machine translation system is empirically found to improve by using the conditional probabilities of phrase pairs computed by the RNN Encoder--Decoder as an additional feature in the existing linear model. Qualitatively, we show that the proposed model learns a semantically and syntactically meaningful representation of linguistic phrases.},

We extend the attention-mechanism with features needed for speech recognition. We show that while an adaptation of the model used for machine translation reaches a competitive 18.6$\backslash${\%} phoneme error rate (PER) on the TIMIT phoneme recognition task, it can only be applied to utterances which are roughly as long as the ones it was trained on. We offer a qualitative explanation of this failure and propose a novel and generic method of adding location-awareness to the attention mechanism to alleviate this issue. The new method yields a model that is robust to long inputs and achieves 18$\backslash${\%} PER in single utterances and 20$\backslash${\%} in 10-times longer (repeated) utterances. Finally, we propose a change to the attention mechanism that prevents it from concentrating too much on single frames, which further reduces PER to 17.6$\backslash${\%} level.},

abstract = {In this paper we compare different types of recurrent units in recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Especially, we focus on more sophisticated units that implement a gating mechanism, such as a long short-term memory (LSTM) unit and a recently proposed gated recurrent unit (GRU). We evaluate these recurrent units on the tasks of polyphonic music modeling and speech signal modeling. Our experiments revealed that these advanced recurrent units are indeed better than more traditional recurrent units such as tanh units. Also, we found GRU to be comparable to LSTM.},

abstract = {In this paper we introduce a generative parametric model capable of producing high quality samples of natural images. Our approach uses a cascade of convolutional networks within a Laplacian pyramid framework to generate images in a coarse-to-fine fashion. At each level of the pyramid, a separate generative convnet model is trained using the Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) approach (Goodfellow et al.). Samples drawn from our model are of significantly higher quality than alternate approaches. In a quantitative assessment by human evaluators, our CIFAR10 samples were mistaken for real images around 40{\%} of the time, compared to 10{\%} for samples drawn from a GAN baseline model. We also show samples from models trained on the higher resolution images of the LSUN scene dataset.},

A system is presented that simultaneously learns to read notes, listens to music and matches the currently played music to its corresponding notes in the sheet. It consists of an end-to-end multi-modal convolu-tional neural network that takes as input images of sheet music and spectrograms of the respective audio snippets. It learns to predict, for a given unseen audio snippet (cov-ering approximately one bar of music), the corresponding position in the respective score line. Our results suggest that with the use of (deep) neural networks â which have proven to be powerful image processing models â working with sheet music becomes feasible and a promising future research direction.},

abstract = {The language identification (LID) task in the Robust Automatic Transcription of Speech (RATS) program is challenging due to the noisy nature of the audio data collected over highly de-graded radio communication channels as well as the use of short duration speech segments for testing. In this paper, we report the recent advances made in the RATS LID task by using bottle-neck features from a convolutional neural network (CNN). The CNN, which is trained with labelled data from one of target lan-guages, generates bottleneck features which are used in a Gaus-sian mixture model (GMM)-ivector LID system. The CNN bot-tleneck features provide substantial complimentary information to the conventional acoustic features even on languages not seen in its training. Using these bottleneck features in conjunction with acoustic features, we obtain significant improvements (av-erage relative improvements of 25{\%} in terms of equal error rate (EER) compared to the corresponding acoustic system) for the LID task. Furthermore, these improvements are consistent for various choices of acoustic features as well as speech segment durations.},

abstract = {We propose a new framework for estimating generative models via an adversarial process, in which we simultaneously train two models: a generative model G that captures the data distribution, and a discriminative model D that estimates the probability that a sample came from the training data rather than G. The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples.},

abstract = {Many real-world sequence learning tasks re- quire the prediction of sequences of labels from noisy, unsegmented input data. In speech recognition, for example, an acoustic signal is transcribed into words or sub-word units. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are powerful sequence learners that would seem well suited to such tasks. However, because they require pre-segmented training data, and post-processing to transform their out- puts into label sequences, their applicability has so far been limited. This paper presents a novel method for training RNNs to label un- segmented sequences directly, thereby solv- ing both problems. An experiment on the TIMIT speech corpus demonstrates its ad- vantages over both a baseline HMM and a hybrid HMM-RNN.},

abstract = {This paper presents a speech recognition system that directly transcribes audio data with text, without requiring an intermediate phonetic representation. The system is based on a combination of the deep bidirectional LSTM recurrent neural network architecture and the Connectionist Temporal Classification objective function. A modification to the objective function is introduced that trains the network to minimise the expectation of an arbitrary transcription loss function. This allows a direct optimisation of the word error rate, even in the absence of a lexicon or language model. The system achieves a word error rate of 27.3{\%} on the Wall Street Journal corpus with no prior linguistic information, 21.9{\%} with only a lexicon of allowedwords, and 8.2{\%} with a trigram language model. Combining the network with a baseline system further reduces the error rate to 6.7{\%}.},

abstract = {Deep Bidirectional LSTM (DBLSTM) recurrent neural networks have recently been shown to give state-of-the-art performance on the TIMIT speech database. However, the results in that work relied on recurrent-neural-network-specific objective functions, which are difficult to integrate with existing large vocabulary speech recognition systems. This paper investigates the use of DBLSTM as an acoustic model in a standard neural network-HMM hybrid system. We find that a DBLSTM-HMM hybrid gives equally good results on TIMIT as the previous work. It also outperforms both GMM and deep network benchmarks on a subset of the Wall Street Journal corpus. However the improvement in word error rate over the deep network is modest, despite a great increase in framelevel accuracy. We conclude that the hybrid approach with DBLSTM appears to be well suited for tasks where acoustic modelling predominates. Further investigation needs to be conducted to understand how to better leverage the improvements in frame-level accuracy towards better word error rates.},

End-to-end training methods such as Connectionist Temporal Classification make it possible to train RNNs for sequence labelling problems where the input-output alignment is unknown. The combination of these methods with the Long Short-term Memory RNN architecture has proved particularly fruitful, delivering state-of-the-art results in cursive handwriting recognition. However RNN performance in speech recognition has so far been disappointing, with better results returned by deep feedforward networks. This paper investigates $\backslash$emph{\{}deep recurrent neural networks{\}}, which combine the multiple levels of representation that have proved so effective in deep networks with the flexible use of long range context that empowers RNNs. When trained end-to-end with suitable regularisation, we find that deep Long Short-term Memory RNNs achieve a test set error of 17.7{\%} on the TIMIT phoneme recognition benchmark, which to our knowledge is the best recorded score.},

In this work, we are exploring the possibility of obtaining the features directly from neural net without the necessity of converting output probabilities to features suitable for subsequent GMM-HMM system. We experimented with 5-layer MLP with bottle-neck in the middle layer. After training such a neural net, we used outputs of the bottle-neck as features for GMM-HMM recognition system. The benefits are twofold: first, improvement was gained when these features are used instead of the probabilistic features, second, the size of the system was reduced, as only part of the neural net is used. The experiments were performed on meetings recognition task defined in MST RT'05 evaluation},

abstract = {We present a state-of-the-art speech recognition system developed using end-toend deep learning. Our architecture is significantly simpler than traditional speech systems, which rely on laboriously engineered processing pipelines; these traditional systems also tend to perform poorly when used in noisy environments. In contrast, our system does not need hand-designed components to model background noise, reverberation, or speaker variation, but instead directly learns a function that is robust to such effects. We do not need a phoneme dictionary, nor even the concept of a âphoneme.â Key to our approach is a well-optimized RNN training system that uses multiple GPUs, as well as a set of novel data synthesis techniques that allow us to efficiently obtain a large amount of varied data for training. Our system, called Deep Speech, outperforms previously published results on the widely studied Switchboard Hub5'00, achieving 16.0{\%} error on the full test set. Deep Speech also handles challenging noisy environments better than widely used, state-of-the-art commercial speech systems.},

abstract = {In this paper we examine the issues of aligning and correcting approximate human generated transcripts for long audio ï¬les. Accurate time-aligned transcriptions help provide easier access to audio materials by aiding downstream applications such as the indexing, summarizing and retrieving of audio segments. Accurate time alignments are also necessary when incorporating audio data into the training data for a speech recognizer's acoustic model. We provide some initial analysis of manual transcriptions which show that there can be signiï¬- cant differences between the âapproximateâ manual transcripts generated by typical commercial transcription services and what was actually spoken in the recording. We then present a new alignment approach for approximate transcriptions of long audio ï¬les which is designed to discover and correct errors in the manual transcription during the alignment process.},

abstract = {In this article, we studied the objective functions of MMI, MCE, and MPE/MWE for discriminative learning in sequential pattern recognition. We presented an approach that unifies the objective functions of MMI, MCE, and MPE/MWE in a common rational-function form of (25). The exact structure of the rational-function form for each discriminative criterion was derived and studied. While the rational-function form of MMI has been known in the past, we provided the theoretical proof that the similar rational-function form exists for the objective functions of MCE and MPE/MWE. Moreover, we showed that the rational function forms for objective functions of MMI, MCE, and MPE/MWE differ in the constant weighting factors CDT (s1 . . . sR) and these weighting factors depend only on the labeled sequence s1 . . . sR, and are independent of the parameter set - to be optimized. The derived rational-function form for MMI, MCE, and MPE/MWE allows the GT/EBW-based parameter optimization framework to be applied directly in discriminative learning. In the past, lack of the appropriate rational-function form was a difficulty for MCE and MPE/MWE, because without this form, the GT/EBW-based parameter optimization framework cannot be directly applied. Based on the unified rational-function form, in a tutorial style, we derived the GT/EBW-based parameter optimization formulas for both discrete HMMs and CDHMMs in discriminative learning using MMI, MCE, and MPE/MWE criteria. The unifying review provided in this article has been based upon a large number of earlier contributions that have been cited and discussed throughout the article. Here we provide a brief summary of such background work. Extension to large-scale speech recognition tasks was accomplished in the work of [59] and [60]. The dissertation of [47] further improved the MMI criterion to that of MPE/MWE. In a parallel vein, the work of [20] provided an alternative approach to that of [41], with an attempt to more rigorously provide - - a CDHMM model re-estimation formula that gives positive growth of the MMI objective function. A crucial error of this attempt was corrected in [2] for establishing an existence proof of such positive growth. The main goal of this article is to provide an underlying foundation for MMI, MCE, and MPE/MWE at the objective function level to facilitate the development of new parameter optimization techniques and to incorporate other pattern recognition concepts, e.g., discriminative margins [66], into the current discriminative learning paradigm.},

abstract = {Hidden Markov model speech recognition systems typically use Gaussian mixture models to estimate the distributions of decorrelated acoustic feature vectors that correspond to individual subword units. By contrast, hybrid connectionist-HMM systems use discriminatively-trained neural networks to estimate the probability distribution among subword units given the acoustic observations. In this work we show a large improvement in word recognition performance by combining neural-net discriminative feature processing with Gaussian-mixture distribution modeling. By training the network to generate the subword probability posteriors, then using transformations of these estimates as the base features for a conventionally-trained Gaussian-mixture based system, we achieve relative error rate reductions of 35{\%} or more on the multicondition Aurora noisy continuous digits task},

abstract = {A very simple way to improve the performance of almost any machine learning algorithm is to train many different models on the same data and then to average their predictions. Unfortunately, making predictions using a whole ensemble of models is cumbersome and may be too computationally expensive to allow deployment to a large number of users, especially if the individual models are large neural nets. Caruana and his collaborators have shown that it is possible to compress the knowledge in an ensemble into a single model which is much easier to deploy and we develop this approach further using a different compression technique. We achieve some surprising results on MNIST and we show that we can significantly improve the acoustic model of a heavily used commercial system by distilling the knowledge in an ensemble of models into a single model. We also introduce a new type of ensemble composed of one or more full models and many specialist models which learn to distinguish fine-grained classes that the full models confuse. Unlike a mixture of experts, these specialist models can be trained rapidly and in parallel.},

abstract = {Recurrent nets are in principle capable to store past inputs to produce the currently desired output. Because of this property recurrent nets are used in time series prediction and process control. Practical applications involve temporal dependencies spanning many time steps, e.g. between relevant inputs and desired outputs. In this case, however, gradient based learning methods take too much time. The extremely increased learning time arises because the error vanishes as it gets propagated back. In this article the de-caying error flow is theoretically analyzed. Then methods trying to overcome vanishing gradients are briefly discussed. Finally, experiments comparing conventional algorithms and alternative methods are presented. With advanced methods long time lag problems can be solved in reasonable time.},

abstract = {Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient-based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O(1). Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

In this paper we report results of a DBN-pretrained context-dependent ANN/HMM system trained on two datasets that are much larger than any reported previously with DBN-pretrained ANN/HMM systems - 5870 hours of Voice Search and 1400 hours of YouTube data. On the ï¬rst dataset, the pretrained ANN/HMM system outperforms the best Gaussian Mixture Model - Hidden Markov Model (GMM/HMM) baseline, built with a much larger dataset by 3.7{\%} absolute WER, while on the second dataset, it outperforms the GMM/HMM baseline by 4.7{\%} absolute. Maximum Mutual Information (MMI) ï¬ne tuning and model combination using Segmental Conditional Random Fields (SCARF) give additional gains of 0.1{\%} and 0.4{\%} on the ï¬rst dataset and 0.5{\%} and 0.9{\%} absolute on the second dataset.},

abstract = {In this paper we extend previous work on isolated word recognition based on hidden Markov models by replacing the discrete symbol representation of the speech signal by a continuous Gaussian mixture density. In this manner the inherent quantization error introduced by the discrete representation is essentially eliminated. The resulting recogniier was tested on a vocabulary of the 10 digits across a wide range of talkers and test conditions, and shown to have an error rate at least comparable to that of the best template reeognizers and significantly lower than that of the discrete symbol hidden Markov model system. Several issues involved in the training of the continuous density models and in the implementation of the recognizer are discussed.},

abstract = {Long speech-text alignment can facilitate large-scale study of rich spoken language resources that have recently become widely accessible, e.g., collections of audio books, or multime- dia documents. For such resources, the conventional Viterbi- based forced alignment may often be proven inadequate mainly due to mismatched audio and text and/or noisy audio. In this paper, we present SailAlign which is an open-source software toolkit for robust long speech-text alignment that circumvents these restrictions. It implements an adaptive, iterative speech recognition and text alignment scheme that allows for the pro- cessing of very long (and possibly noisy) audio and is robust to transcription errors. SailAlign is evaluated on artificially cre- ated long chunks of the TIMIT database. Audio is artificially contaminated with babble noise, and the corresponding tran- scriptions are corrupted at various levels. We present the corre- sponding word boundary detection results. Finally, we demon- strate the potential use of the software for the exploitation of audio books for the study of read speech.},

Two recurrent neural networks are used as a front-end: the first one models rhythmic content on multiple frequency bands, while the second one models the harmonic content of the signal. The output activations are then combined and fed into a dynamic Bayesian network which acts as a rhythmical language model. We show on seven commonly used datasets of Western music that the system is able to achieve state-of-the-art results.},

@article{Lehner2015,
abstract = {Singing voice detection aims at identifying the regions in a music recording where at least one person sings. This is a challenging problem that cannot be solved without analysing the temporal evolution of the signal. Current state-of-the-art methods combine timbral with temporal characteristics, by summarising various feature values over time, e.g. by computing their variance. This leads to more contextual information, but also to increased latency, which is problematic if our goal is on-line, real-time singing voice detection. To overcome this problem and reduce the necessity to include context in the features themselves, we introduce a method that uses Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM-RNN). In experiments on several data sets, the resulting singing voice detector outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in terms of accuracy, while at the same time drastically reducing latency and increasing the time resolution of the detector.},

abstract = {This paper proposes two novel frontends for robust lan- guage identification (LID) using a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained for automatic speech recognition (ASR). In the CNN/i-vector frontend, the CNN is used to obtain the posterior probabilities for i-vector training and extraction instead of a uni- versal background model (UBM). The CNN/posterior frontend is somewhat similar to a phonetic system in that the occupation counts of (tied) triphone states (senones) given by the CNN are used for classification. They are compressed to a low dimen- sional vector using probabilistic principal component analysis (PPCA). Evaluated on heavily degraded speech data, the pro- posed front ends provide significant improvements of up to 50{\%} on average equal error rate compared to a UBM/i-vector base- line. Moreover, the proposed frontends are complementary and give significant gains of up to 20{\%} relative to the best single system when combined. 1.},

abstract = {Previous work on whispered speech recognition has shown that acoustic models (AM) trained on whispered speech can some-what classify unwhispered (neutral) speech sounds, but not vice versa. In fact, AMs trained purely on neutral speech completely fail to recognize whispered speech. Meanwhile, recipes used to train neutral AMs will work just as well for whispered speech, but such methods require a large volume of transcribed whis-pered speech which is expensive to gather. In this work, we propose and investigate the use of bottleneck feature networks to normalize differences between whispered and neutral speech modes. Our extensive experiments show that this type of speech variability can be effectively normalized. We also show that it is possible to transfer this knowledge from two source languages with whispered speech (Mandarin and English), to a new target language (Malay) without whispered speech. Furthermore, we report a substantial reduction in word error rate for cross-mode speech recognition, effectively demonstrate that it is possible to train acoustic models capable of classifying both types of speech without needing any additional whispered speech.},

abstract = {Attention-based encoder-decoder neural network models have recently shown promising results in machine translation and speech recognition. In this work, we propose an attention-based neural network model for joint intent detection and slot filling, both of which are critical steps for many speech understanding and dialog systems. Unlike in machine translation and speech recognition, alignment is explicit in slot filling. We explore different strategies in incorporating this alignment information to the encoder-decoder framework. Learning from the attention mechanism in encoder-decoder model, we further propose introducing attention to the alignment-based RNN models. Such attentions provide additional information to the intent classification and slot label prediction. Our independent task models achieve state-of-the-art intent detection error rate and slot filling F1 score on the benchmark ATIS task. Our joint training model further obtains 0.56{\%} absolute (23.8{\%} relative) error reduction on intent detection and 0.23{\%} absolute gain on slot filling over the independent task models.},

abstract = {We study the segmental recurrent neural network for end-to-end acoustic modelling. This model connects the segmental conditional random field (CRF) with a recurrent neural network (RNN) used for feature extraction. Compared to most previous CRF-based acoustic models, it does not rely on an external system to provide features or segmentation boundaries. Instead, this model marginalises out all the possible segmentations, and features are extracted from the RNN trained together with the segmental CRF. In essence, this model is self-contained and can be trained end-to-end. In this paper, we discuss practical training and decoding issues as well as the method to speed up the training in the context of speech recognition. We performed experiments on the TIMIT dataset. We achieved 17.3 phone error rate (PER) from the first-pass decoding --- the best reported result using CRFs, despite the fact that we only used a zeroth-order CRF and without using any language model.},

abstract = {An attentional mechanism has lately been used to improve neural machine translation (NMT) by selectively focusing on parts of the source sentence during translation. However, there has been little work exploring useful architectures for attention-based NMT. This paper examines two simple and effective classes of attentional mechanism: a global approach which always attends to all source words and a local one that only looks at a subset of source words at a time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of both approaches over the WMT translation tasks between English and German in both directions. With local attention, we achieve a significant gain of 5.0 BLEU points over non-attentional systems which already incorporate known techniques such as dropout. Our ensemble model using different attention architectures has established a new state-of-the-art result in the WMT'15 English to German translation task with 25.9 BLEU points, an improvement of 1.0 BLEU points over the existing best system backed by NMT and an n-gram reranker.},

abstract = {Understanding the mood of music holds great potential for recommendation and genre identiï¬cation problems. Unfortu- nately, hand-annotating music with mood tags is usually an expensive, time-consuming and subjective process, to such an extent that automatic mood recognition methods are re- quired. In this paper we present a new unsupervised learn- ing approach for mood recognition, based on the lyrics and the audio of a song. Our system thus eliminates the need for ground truth mood annotations, even for training the system. We hypothesize that lyrics and audio are both partially de- termined by the mood, and that there are no other strong com- mon effects affecting these aspects of music. Based on this as- sumption, mood can be detected by performing a multi-modal analysis, identifying what lyrics and audio have in common. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this using Canonical Cor- relation Analysis, and conï¬rm our hypothesis in a subsequent analysis of the results.},

As preprocessing, the sys- tem uses a voice separation algorithm based on melody transcrip- tion and sinusoidal modeling. The alignment is based on a hid- den Markov model speech recognizer where the acoustic model is adapted to singing voice. The textual input is preprocessed to create a language model consisting of a sequence of phonemes, pauses and possible instrumental breaks. Viterbi algorithmis used to align the audio features with the text. On a test set consisting of 17 commercial recordings, the system achieves an average ab- solute error of 1.40 seconds in aligning lines of the lyrics.},

Maximum likelihood linear regres- sion (MLLR) techniques are studied, with speciï¬c details in choosing the number and types of transforms. The recog- nition performance of the different methods is measured in terms of phoneme recognition rate and singing-to-lyrics alignment errors of the adapted recognizers. Different meth- ods improve the correct recognition rate with up to 10 per- centage units, compared to the non-adapted system. In singing-to-alignment we obtain a best of 0.94 seconds mean absolute alignment error, compared to 1.26 seconds for the non-adapted system. Global adaptation was found to provide the most improvement in the performance, but small further improvement was obtained with regression tree adaptation.},

abstract = {Deep Belief Networks (DBNs) are a very competitive alternative to Gaussian mixture models for relating states of a hidden Markov model to frames of coefficients derived from the acoustic input. They are competitive for three reasons: DBNs can be fine-tuned as neural networks; DBNs have many non-linear hidden layers; and DBNs are generatively pre-trained. This paper illustrates how each of these three aspects contributes to the DBN's good recognition performance using both phone recognition performance on the TIMIT corpus and a dimensionally reduced visualization of the relationships between the feature vectors learned by the DBNs that preserves the similarity structure of the feature vectors at multiple scales. The same two methods are also used to investigate the most suitable type of input representation for a DBN.},

abstract = {Gaussian mixture models are currently the dominant technique for modeling the emission distribution of hidden Markov models for speech recognition. We show that better phone recognition on the TIMIT dataset can be achieved by replacing Gaussian mixture models by deep neural networks that contain many layers of features and a very large number of parameters. These networks are first pre-trained as a multi-layer generative model of a window of spectral feature vectors without making use of any discriminative information. Once the generative pre-training has designed the features, we perform discriminative fine-tuning using backpropagation to adjust the features slightly to make them better at predicting a probability distribution over the states of monophone hidden Markov models.},

This automaton encodes a highly constrained language model trained on the transcripts. We show competitive results with n-gram models in several testing scenarios. Preliminary experiments show perfect alignments at a reduced computational load and with a smaller memory footprint when compared to n-gram models.},

abstract = {We present a new system for the harmonic analysis of popular musical audio. It is focused on chord estimation, although the proposed system additionally estimates the key sequence and bass notes. It is distinct from competing approaches in two main ways. First, it makes use of a new improved chromagram repre- sentation of audio that takes the human perception of loudness into account. Furthermore, it is the first system for joint estima- tion of chords, keys, and bass notes that is fully based on machine learning, requiring no expert knowledge to tune the parameters. This means that it will benefit from future increases in available annotated audio files, broadening its applicability to a wider range of genres. In all of three evaluation scenarios, including a new one that allows evaluation on audio for which no complete ground truth annotation is available, the proposed system is shown to be faster, more memory efficient, and more accurate than the state-of-the- art.},

abstract = {Most phoneme recognition state-of-the-art systems rely on a classical neural network classifiers, fed with highly tuned features, such as MFCC or PLP features. Recent advances in ``deep learning'' approaches questioned such systems, but while some attempts were made with simpler features such as spectrograms, state-of-the-art systems still rely on MFCCs. This might be viewed as a kind of failure from deep learning approaches, which are often claimed to have the ability to train with raw signals, alleviating the need of hand-crafted features. In this paper, we investigate a convolutional neural network approach for raw speech signals. While convolutional architectures got tremendous success in computer vision or text processing, they seem to have been let down in the past recent years in the speech processing field. We show that it is possible to learn an end-to-end phoneme sequence classifier system directly from raw signal, with similar performance on the TIMIT and WSJ datasets than existing systems based on MFCC, questioning the need of complex hand-crafted features on large datasets.},

abstract = {In hybrid hidden Markov model/artificial neural networks (HMM/ANN) automatic speech recognition (ASR) system, the phoneme class conditional probabilities are estimated by first extracting acoustic features from the speech signal based on prior knowledge such as, speech perception or/and speech pro- duction knowledge, and, then modeling the acoustic features with an ANN. Recent advances in machine learning techniques, more specifically in the field of image processing and text pro- cessing, have shown that such divide and conquer strategy (i.e., separating feature extraction and modeling steps) may not be necessary. Motivated from these studies, in the framework of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), this paper investigates a novel approach, where the input to the ANN is raw speech signal and the output is phoneme class conditional probabil- ity estimates. On TIMIT phoneme recognition task, we study different ANN architectures to show the benefit of CNNs and compare the proposed approach against conventional approach where, spectral-based feature MFCC is extracted and modeled by a multilayer perceptron. Our studies show that the proposed approach can yield comparable or better phoneme recognition performance when compared to the conventional approach. It indicates that CNNs can learn features relevant for phoneme classification automatically from the raw speech signal. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2013 ISCA.},

In our recent works, we have shown that, in the framework of con-volutional neural networks (CNN), the relationship between the raw speech signal and the phones can be directly modeled and ASR systems competitive to standard approach can be built. In this paper, we first analyze and show that, between the first two convolutional layers, the CNN learns (in parts) and models the phone-specific spectral envelope information of 2-4 ms speech. Given that we show that the CNN-based approach yields ASR trends similar to standard short-term spectral based ASR sys-tem under mismatched (noisy) conditions, with the CNN-based approach being more robust.},

Two classes of approaches are studied: in the first class, only existing phonetic recognizers are employed, whereas an additional phonetic recognizer in the new language is created for the second class. It is found that the number of acoustic recognizers employed plays a crucial role in determining the recognition accuracy for the new language. We study different approaches to incorporating a language for which audio-only data is available (no pronunciation dictionaries or transcriptions) and find that if more than about 2 000 training utterances are available, a bootstrapped acoustic model for the new language can improve accuracy substantially.},

Comparatively, unsupervised learning with CNNs has received less attention. In this work we hope to help bridge the gap between the success of CNNs for supervised learning and unsupervised learning. We introduce a class of CNNs called deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGANs), that have certain architectural constraints, and demonstrate that they are a strong candidate for unsupervised learning. Training on various image datasets, we show convincing evidence that our deep convolutional adversarial pair learns a hierarchy of representations from object parts to scenes in both the generator and discriminator. Additionally, we use the learned features for novel tasks - demonstrating their applicability as general image representations.},

abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are an alternative type of neural network that can be used to reduce spectral variations and model spectral correlations which exist in signals. Since speech signals exhibit both of these properties, CNNs are a more effective model for speech compared to Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). In this paper, we explore applying CNNs to large vocabulary speech tasks. First, we determine the appropriate architecture to make CNNs effective compared to DNNs for LVCSR tasks. Specifically, we focus on how many convolutional layers are needed, what is the optimal number of hidden units, what is the best pooling strategy, and the best input feature type for CNNs. We then explore the be- havior of neural network features extracted from CNNs on a vari- ety of LVCSR tasks, comparing CNNs to DNNs and GMMs. We find that CNNs offer between a 13-30{\%} relative improvement over GMMs, and a 4-12{\%} relative improvement over DNNs, on a 400-hr Broadcast News and 300-hr Switchboard task.},

abstract = {Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture that has been designed to address the vanishing and exploding gradient problems of conventional RNNs. Unlike feedforward neural networks, RNNs have cyclic connections making them powerful for modeling sequences. They have been successfully used for sequence labeling and sequence prediction tasks, such as handwriting recognition, language modeling, phonetic labeling of acoustic frames. However, in contrast to the deep neural networks, the use of RNNs in speech recognition has been limited to phone recognition in small scale tasks. In this paper, we present novel LSTM based RNN architectures which make more effective use of model parameters to train acoustic models for large vocabulary speech recognition. We train and compare LSTM, RNN and DNN models at various numbers of parameters and configurations. We show that LSTM models converge quickly and give state of the art speech recognition performance for relatively small sized models.},

In song, language and music are merged into one acoustic signal with two salient dimensions. By manipulating either the linguistic or musical dimensions (or both) of song and studying their relationships, it is possible to gain important information about the neural networks underlying language and music cognition. We will present a brief review followed by recent behavioral, electrophysiological, and neuroimaging studies concerned with the functional and structural relationships of music and language. These results, together with the previous studies in the field, help understanding whether the different levels of music and language processing are independent or interactive.},

abstract = {In this paper we demonstrate how to improve the performance of deep neural network (DNN) acoustic models using multi-task learning. In multi-task learning, the network is trained to perform both the primary classification task and one or more secondary tasks using a shared representation. The additional model parameters associated with the secondary tasks represent a very small increase in the number of trained parameters, and can be discarded at runtime. In this paper, we explore three natural choices for the secondary task: the phone label, the phone context, and the state context. We demonstrate that, even on a strong baseline, multi-task learning can provide a significant decrease in error rate. Using phone context, the phonetic error rate (PER) on TIMIT is reduced from 21.63{\%} to 20.25{\%} on the core test set, and surpassing the best performance in the literature for a DNN that uses a standard feed-forward network architecture.},

abstract = {Recurrent neural network architectures combining with attention mechanism, or neural attention model, have shown promising performance recently for the tasks including speech recognition, image caption generation, visual question answering and machine translation. In this paper, neural attention model is applied on two sequence classification tasks, dialogue act detection and key term extraction. In the sequence labeling tasks, the model input is a sequence, and the output is the label of the input sequence. The major difficulty of sequence labeling is that when the input sequence is long, it can include many noisy or irrelevant part. If the information in the whole sequence is treated equally, the noisy or irrelevant part may degrade the classification performance. The attention mechanism is helpful for sequence classification task because it is capable of highlighting important part among the entire sequence for the classification task. The experimental results show that with the attention mechanism, discernible improvements were achieved in the sequence labeling task considered here. The roles of the attention mechanism in the tasks are further analyzed and visualized in this paper.},

The architecture of the proposed model is analogous to speech recognition systems and comprises an acoustic model and a music language mode{\}}. The acoustic model is a neural network used for estimating the probabilities of pitches in a frame of audio. The language model is a recurrent neural network that models the correlations between pitch combinations over time. The proposed model is general and can be used to transcribe polyphonic music without imposing any constraints on the polyphony or the number or type of instruments. The acoustic and language model predictions are combined using a probabilistic graphical model. Inference over the output variables is performed using the beam search algorithm. We investigate various neural network architectures for the acoustic models and compare their performance to two popular state-of-the-art acoustic models. We also present an efficient variant of beam search that improves performance and reduces run-times by an order of magnitude, making the model suitable for real-time applications. We evaluate the model's performance on the MAPS dataset and show that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art transcription systems.},

abstract = {Neural networks have become increasingly popular for the task of language modeling. Whereas feed-forward networks only exploit a fixed context length to predict the next word of a se- quence, conceptually, standard recurrent neural networks can take into account all of the predecessor words. On the other hand, it is well known that recurrent networks are difficult to train and therefore are unlikely to show the full potential of re- current models. These problems are addressed by a the Long Short-Term Memory neural network architecture. In this work, we ana- lyze this type of network on an English and a large French language modeling task. Experiments show improvements of about 8 {\%} relative in perplexity over standard recurrent neural network LMs. In addition, we gain considerable improvements in WER on top of a state-of-the-art speech recognition system.},

abstract = {Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are powerful models that have achieved excel-lent performance on difficult learning tasks. Although DNNs work well whenever large labeled training sets are available, they cannot be used to map sequences to sequences. In this paper, we present a general end-to-end approach to sequence learning that makes minimal assumptions on the sequence structure. Our method uses a multilayered Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to map the input sequence to a vector of a fixed dimensionality, and then another deep LSTM to decode the target sequence from the vector. Our main result is that on an English to French translation task from the WMT-14 dataset, the translations produced by the LSTM achieve a BLEU score of 34.8 on the entire test set, where the LSTM's BLEU score was penalized on out-of-vocabulary words. Additionally, the LSTM did not have difficulty on long sentences. For comparison, a phrase-based SMT system achieves a BLEU score of 33.3 on the same dataset. When we used the LSTM to rerank the 1000 hypotheses produced by the aforementioned SMT system, its BLEU score increases to 36.5, which is close to the previous state of the art. The LSTM also learned sensible phrase and sentence representations that are sensitive to word order and are relatively invariant to the active and the passive voice. Fi-nally, we found that reversing the order of the words in all source sentences (but not target sentences) improved the LSTM's performance markedly, because doing so introduced many short term dependencies between the source and the target sentence which made the optimization problem easier.},

@article{Thambiratnam2005,
abstract = {Keyword Spotting is the task of detecting keywords of interest within continu- ous speech. The applications of this technology range from call centre dialogue systems to covert speech surveillance devices. Keyword spotting is particularly well suited to data mining tasks such as real-time keyword monitoring and unre- stricted vocabulary audio document indexing. However, to date, many keyword spotting approaches have suered from poor detection rates, high false alarm rates, or slow execution times, thus reducing their commercial viability. This work investigates the application of keyword spotting to data mining tasks. The thesis makes a number of major contributions to the eld of keyword spotting. The rst major contribution is the development of a novel keyword verication method named Cohort Word Verication. This method combines high level lin- guistic information with cohort-based verication techniques to obtain dramatic improvements in verication performance, in particular for the problematic short duration target word class. The second major contribution is the development of a novel audio document indexing technique named Dynamic Match Lattice Spotting. This technique aug- ments lattice-based audio indexing principles with dynamic sequence matching techniques to provide robustness to erroneous lattice realisations. The resulting algorithm obtains signicant improvement in detection rate over lattice-based audio document indexing while still maintaining extremely fast search speeds. The third major contribution is the study of multiple verier fusion for the task of keyword verication. The reported experiments demonstrate that substantial improvements in verication performance can be obtained through the fusion of multiple keyword veriers. The research focuses on combinations of speech background model based veriers and cohort word veriers. The nal major contribution is a comprehensive study of the eects of limited training data for keyword spotting. This study is performed with consideration as to how these eects impact the immediate development and deployment of speech technologies for non-English languages.},

@article{Trigeorgis2016,
abstract = {The automatic recognition of spontaneous emotions from speech is a challenging task. On the one hand, acoustic features need to be robust enough to capture the emotional content for various styles of speaking, and while on the other, machine learning algorithms need to be insensitive to outliers while being able to model the context. Whereas the latter has been tackled by the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, the former is still under very active in-vestigations, even though more than a decade of research has provided a large set of acoustic descriptors. In this pa-per, we propose a solution to the problem of 'context-aware' emotional relevant feature extraction, by combining Convo-lutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with LSTM networks, in order to automatically learn the best representation of the speech signal directly from the raw time representation. In this novel work on the so-called end-to-end speech emotion recognition, we show that the use of the proposed topology significantly outperforms the traditional approaches based on signal processing techniques for the prediction of sponta-neous and natural emotions on the RECOLA database.},

The algorithm uses a combinatorially hashed time-frequency constellation analysis of the audio, yielding unusual properties such as transparency, in which multiple tracks mixed together may each be identified. Furthermore, for applications such as radio monitoring, search times on the order of a few milliseconds per query are attained, even on a massive music database.},

abstract = {Voice search is the technology underlying many spoken dialog systems (SDSs) that provide users with the information they request with a spoken query. The information normally exists in a large database, and the query has to be compared with a field in the database to obtain the relevant information. The contents of the field, such as business or product names, are often unstructured text. This article categorized spoken dialog technology into form filling, call routing, and voice search, and reviewed the voice search technology. The categorization was made from the technological perspective. It is important to note that a single SDS may apply the technology from multiple categories. Robustness is the central issue in voice search. The technology in acoustic modeling aims at improved robustness to environment noise, different channel conditions, and speaker variance; the pronunciation research addresses the problem of unseen word pronunciation and pronunciation variance; the language model research focuses on linguistic variance; the studies in search give rise to improved robustness to linguistic variance and ASR errors; the dialog management research enables graceful recovery from confusions and understanding errors; and the learning in the feedback loop speeds up system tuning for more robust performance. While tremendous achievements have been accomplished in the past decade on voice search, large challenges remain. Many voice search dialog systems have automation rates around or below 50{\%} in field trials.},

abstract = {We present a prototype that automatically aligns acoustic musical signals with their corresponding textual lyrics, in a manner similar to manually-aligned karaoke. We tackle this problem using a multimodal approach, where the appropriate pairing of audio and text processing helps create a more accurate system. Our audio processing technique uses a combination of top-down and bottom-up approaches, combining the strength of low-level audio features and high-level musical knowledge to determine the hierarchical rhythm structure, singing voice and chorus sections in the musical audio. Text processing is also employed to approximate the length of the sung passages using the textual lyrics. Results show an average error of less than one bar for per-line alignment of the lyrics on a test bed of 20 songs (sampled from CD audio and carefully selected for variety). We perform holistic and per-component testing and analysis and outline steps for further development.},

The theoretical study is backed up by experiments with inverse filtering and other types of glottography. Special attention is devoted to time-varying bandwidths within a glottal open period and the implications for defining overall effective bandwidths. The presence in the speech wave of voice source components as well as the presence of formant oscillation in the glottal flow are discussed. Expressions for supra- and sub-glottal pressure fluctuations are also derived. An earlier proposed parametric model of glottal flow and formant excitation is reviewed and discussed with respect to voice intensity and some dynamic factor in connected speech.},

abstract = {We propose DEEPMEMORY, a novel deep architecture for sequence-to-sequence learning, which performs the task through a series of nonlinear transformations from the representation of the input sequence (e.g., a Chinese sentence) to the final output sequence (e.g., translation to English). Inspired by the recently proposed Neural Turing Machine (Graves et al., 2014), we store the intermediate representations in stacked layers of memories, and use read-write operations on the memories to realize the nonlinear transformations between the representations. The types of transformations are designed in advance but the parameters are learned from data. Through layer-by-layer transformations, DEEPMEMORY can model complicated relations between sequences necessary for applications such as machine translation between distant languages. The architecture can be trained with normal back-propagation on sequenceto-sequence data, and the learning can be easily scaled up to a large corpus. DEEPMEMORY is broad enough to subsume the state-of-the-art neural translation model in (Bahdanau et al., 2015) as its special case, while significantly improving upon the model with its deeper architecture. Remarkably, DEEPMEMORY, being purely neural network-based, can achieve performance comparable to the traditional phrase-based machine translation system Moses with a small vocabulary and a modest parameter size.},

abstract = {Recently, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as powerful sequence models have re-emerged as a potential acoustic model for statistical parametric speech synthesis (SPSS). The long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture is particularly attractive because it addresses the vanishing gradient problem in standard RNNs, making them easier to train. Although recent studies have demonstrated that LSTMs can achieve significantly better performance on SPSS than deep feed-forward neural networks, little is known about why. Here we attempt to answer two questions: a) why do LSTMs work well as a sequence model for SPSS; b) which component (e.g., input gate, output gate, forget gate) is most important. We present a visual analysis alongside a series of experiments, resulting in a proposal for a simplified architecture. The simplified architecture has significantly fewer parameters than an LSTM, thus reducing generation complexity considerably without degrading quality.},

This paper presents an approach in which they are utilized in the front-end of a speaker recognition system. The network inputs are mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) from multiple consec-utive frames and the outputs are speaker labels. We propose using a recording-level criterion that is optimized via an online learning algorithm. We furthermore propose retraining a net-work to focus on its errors when leveraging scores from an inde-pendently trained system. We ran experiments on the same-and different-microphone tasks of the 2010 NIST Speaker Recogni-tion Evaluation. We found that the proposed bottleneck feature extraction paradigm performs slightly worse than MFCCs but provides complementary information in combination. We also found that the proposed combination strategy with re-training improved the EER by 14{\%} and 18{\%} relative over the baseline MFCC system in the same-and different-microphone tasks re-spectively.},

abstract = {Bottleneck features have been shown to be effective in improving the accuracy of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Conventionally, bottleneck features are extracted from a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) trained to predict context-independent monophone states. The MLP typically has three hidden layers and is trained using the backpropagation algorithm. In this paper, we propose two improvements to the training of bottleneck features motivated by recent advances in the use of deep neural networks (DNNs) for speech recognition. First, we show how the use of unsupervised pretraining of a DNN enhances the network's discriminative power and improves the bottleneck features it generates. Second, we show that a neural network trained to predict context-dependent senone targets produces better bottleneck features than one trained to predict monophone states. Bottleneck features trained using the proposed methods produced a 16{\%} relative reduction in sentence error rate over conventional bottleneck features on a large vocabulary business search task.

abstract = {Long short-term memory recurrent neural networks (LSTM-RNNs) have been applied to various speech applications including acoustic modeling for statistical parametric speech synthesis. One of the con- cerns for applying them to text-to-speech applications is its effect on latency. To address this concern, this paper proposes a low-latency, streaming speech synthesis architecture using unidirectional LSTM- RNNs with a recurrent output layer. The use of unidirectional RNN architecture allows frame-synchronous streaming inference of out- put acoustic features given input linguistic features. The recurrent output layer further encourages smooth transition between acoustic features at consecutive frames.

abstract = {Automatic speech recognition by computers can provide the most natural and efficient method of communication between humans and computers. While in recent years high performance speech recognition systems are beginning to emerge from research institutions, scientists unequivocally agree that the deployment of speech recognition systems into realistic operating environments will require many hours of speech data to help us model the inherent variability in the speech signal. This paper describes the experiences of researchers at MIT in the collection of two large speech databases which have somewhat complementary objectives. The timit database was designed to be task and speaker-independent, and is suitable for general acoustic-phonetic research. The voyager database, on the other hand, was intended for development and evaluation of a system which incorporates both speech and natural language processing. This database is particularly valuable as a source of spontaneous utterances elicited in a realistic goal-oriented environment. ?? 1990.},
